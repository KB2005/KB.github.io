This week we learnt about coding and how we change everything using a site called codecademy. We used a code called python and there were twelve levels of which i completed 7 with very little assistance. I got stuck on level eight and i consequently asked for help but i still didn't understand the work. When i arrived home however my brother taught me what to do and i eventually did it.
